# FullStackReactProject
Full Stack Person Information React Project.  The application I created focused on providing detailed information about an individual and their friends.
In my HAVELSAN Internship I build this full stack web application. I use in front-end React and in the back-end Java, Spring Boot. Database: PostgreSQL
